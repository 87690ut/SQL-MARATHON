## 🛠️ Core Skills & Technical Expertise

I have mastered several advanced SQL domains to handle large datasets efficiently and extract meaningful insights.

### 1. 📊 Advanced Analytical Functions (Window Functions)
* **Ranking Logic:** Expert implementation of `RANK()` and `DENSE_RANK()`.
* **Strategic Filtering:** Mastered the logic of applying rankings inside vs. outside subqueries/CTEs to solve complex filtering requirements.
* **Partitioning:** Ability to group data dynamically using `PARTITION BY` to generate category-wise insights.


### 2. ⚡ Database Performance Tuning (Indexing)
* **Execution Efficiency:** Used `CREATE INDEX` to eliminate "Full Table Scans" and move toward "Index Seeks."
* **Join Optimization:** Implemented indexing on Foreign Keys to speed up multi-table joins.
* **Predicate Optimization:** Specialized in indexing columns used in `WHERE` and `ORDER BY` clauses to ensure micro-second response times.


### 3. 🧩 Complex Query Architecture
* **CTEs (Common Table Expressions):** Using `WITH` clauses to build modular, readable, and professional-grade code.
* **Aggregations & Filtering:** Advanced use of `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` for summarized reporting.
* **Subqueries:** Proficient in nested and correlated subqueries for multi-layered data retrieval.

### 4. 🗂️ Database Objects & Formatting
* **Views:** Designing **Virtual Tables** to simplify complex business logic for end-users.
* **Data Precision:** Utilizing `ROUND()` and other mathematical functions for financial accuracy in reporting.
* **Search Optimization:** Enhancing search performance through strategic column indexing.
